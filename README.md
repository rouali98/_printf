# printf Project

This is a group project for implementing a custom `printf` function with specific requirements. The `printf` function is used to produce output according to a given format. The goal is to handle various conversion specifiers and produce the expected output as described in the tasks below.

## Resources
Please read or watch the following resources before starting the project:

- [Secrets of printf](https://example.com/secrets-of-printf)
- [Group Projects concept page](https://example.com/group-projects)
- [Flowcharts concept page](https://example.com/flowcharts)

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Usage of global variables is not allowed
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the `main.h` header file
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file and include guards in all header files
- You are not allowed to use the standard `printf` function
- There should be one project repository per group. Other members should not fork or clone the project to ensure only one team member has the repository in their GitHub account; otherwise, there's a risk of scoring 0%.

### Compilation
Your code will be compiled this way:
